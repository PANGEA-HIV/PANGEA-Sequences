# PANGEA 2 (Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalised Epidemics in Africa) HIV Sequencing project

This repository consists of uploaded [PANGEA](https://www.pangea-hiv.org/) consensus sequences sequenced in different research institutes in Africa for the referencing of publications. Each fasta file and metadata tsv file corresponds to a institute in charged of sampling the sequences. A wholistic metadata file consisting of all sequence metadata is also available. Details of all contributors and sequence locations of the PANGEA sequences are shown below:
