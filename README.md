This repository provides HIV consensus sequences of the [PANGEA-HIV consortium](https://www.pangea-hiv.org/).

HIV sequence data were obtained from participants from multiple cohorts across Africa and generated following deep-sequencing by the [PANGEA-HIV consortium](https://www.pangea-hiv.org). PANGEA-HIV stands for "Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalised Epidemics in Africa". 

The overarching goal of the PANGEA consortium is to identify individual and population level factors that drive the epidemic using HIV-1 phylogenetic data, analyse the dynamics of the epidemic, and translate these findings into information that can be used to design more efficient interventions.

### About the project:

PANGEA-HIV 2 is a collaboration between scientists from the Africa Health Research Institute (South Africa), Rakai Health Sciences Program (Uganda), Johns Hopkins University (USA), Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute (Uganda), Zambart Project (Zambia), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (UK), Imperial College London (UK), Partners in Prevention Project at the University of Washington (USA), Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (Botswana/USA), University of Edinburgh (UK), and the University of Oxford (UK). 

Members of the PANGEA-HIV-2 steering commitee are: 
Fraser, C. (PI), Abeler-Dörner, L., Ayles, H., Bonsall, D., Bowden, R., Calvez, V., Essex, M., Fidler, S., Grabowski, K., Golubchik, T., Gupta, R., Hayes, R., Herbeck, J., Kagaayi, J., Kaleebu, P., Lingappa, J., Moyo, S., Novitsky, V., Ndung’u, T., Pillay, D., Quinn, T., Rambaut, A., Ratmann, O., Seeley, J., Ssemwanga, D., Tanser, F., Wawer, M.

### Publicly available metadata:

Available metadata are provided in a tsv file for each cohort site from which the sequences were sampled, and include

Metadata name | Metadata description
------------- | -------------
**Sequence_ID**  | Randomised PANGEA ID in the format of PG-YY-CC-dddddda<br> PG - PANGEA<br> YY - 2 digit year<br> CC - Country Code<br> dddddd - randomised 6 digits<br> a - alphabet denoting multiple sequence from the same participant on the same visit, increase in alphabet character denote a new sequence 
**Country**  | Sampling country
**Cohort** | Sampling cohort
**Subtype** | Reference Subtype used for the consensus building
**Status** | 
**Date** | Date of  sampling in the format of MM-YYYY
